# Fractal Generator — Mandelbort Set

![illustration](outputs/1745752292.png "Mandelbrot Set")

A small Python tool that produces renders of the Mandelbrot Set based on just several input criteria.

## Using the tool

Different results can be achieved by changing the values in the `config` file. Their purpose is as follows:

* `x_max` — Farthest positive value that will be rendered on the horizontal axis
* `x_min` — Farthest negative value that will be rendered on the horizontal axis
* `y_max` — Farthest positive value that will be rendered on the vertical axis
* `y_min` — Farthest negative value that will be rendered on the vertical axis  
* `img_width` — Width of the render in pixels — height will be automatically calculated to keep proportions extrapolated from x and y min and max
* `max_iterations` — Number of iterations that the function will go through before determining that c is within the set (provided no earlier escape)
* `escape_threshold` — The threshold after which c will be treated as not within the set — note that 2 is a conventional value, changing it can create unpredictable results

Running the main function will render an output with the specifide dimensions and save it into the `outputs/` directiory under the title generated by the time stamp.
