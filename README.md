# Fractal Generator — Mandelbort Set

A small Python tool that produces renders of the Mandelbrot Set based on just several input criteria.

## Using the tool

Different results can be achieved by changing the values in the `config` file. Their purpose is as follows:

* `x_max` — Farthest positive value that will be rendered on the horizontal axis
* `x_min` — Farthest negative value that will be rendered on the horizontal axis
* `y_max` — Farthest positive value that will be rendered on the vertical axis
* `y_min` — Farthest negative value that will be rendered on the vertical axis  
* `img_width` — Width of the render in pixels — height will be automatically calculated to keep proportions extrapolated from x and y min and max
* `max_iterations` — Number of iterations that the function will go through before determining that c is within the set (provided no earlier escape)
* `escape_threshold` — The threshold after which c will be treated as not within the set — note that 2 is a conventional value, changing it can create unpredictable results

Running the main function will render an output with the specifide dimensions and save it into the `outputs/` directiory under the title generated by the time stamp.

### Rendering custom sections

While changing the values discussed above will allow for creating renders of various parts of the Mandelbrot set, it is much easier to use the set of config variables that will ask the script to render a section around a specific center point.

Note that this will *always* result in an image of 1:1 ratio.

Variables that control this behaviour are as follows:

* `custom_area` — Boolean value, needs to be set to `True` in order for the controls bellow to take effect
* `center_x` — The center of the render on the horizontal axis
* `center_y` — The center of the render on the vertical axis
* `spread` — The number that will be added to/subtracted from center values to generate `x_max`/`y_max` and `x_min`/`y_min` variables

### Stylizing the output

The style of the output for the time being is very rudimentary — it is controled by `selected_pallete` variable in the `config` file. For now it supports values of `None` for render in red channel only, or the value of `"catpuccin"` that will use the catpuccin colors.

The latter option is recommended for renders of zoomed in sections.
